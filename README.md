### Readme

sshfs-gui is a GUI wrapper for SSHFS

You need Mac OS X 10.9+ and at least one of the utilities listed below:

  - sshfs from https://github.com/osxfuse/sshfs/releases / http://osxfuse.github.io/
  - MacFUSE from https://code.google.com/p/macfuse/
  - or a custom compiled sshfs from brew, macports, ..

Otherwise this GUI won't function.
