### Readme

sshfs-gui is a GUI wrapper for either MacFUSE SSHFS (preferred) or the implementation at http://pqrs.org/macosx/sshfs/

You need Mac OS X 10.5+ and at least one of the utilities listed below:

  - sshfs from https://github.com/osxfuse/sshfs/releases / http://osxfuse.github.io/
  - MacFUSE from https://code.google.com/p/macfuse/

Otherwise this GUI won't function.

### Credits
